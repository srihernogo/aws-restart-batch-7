26. A photo sharing web application wants to store thumbnails of user-uploaded images on Amazon S3. The thumbnails are rarely used but need to be immediately accessible from the web application. The thumbnails can be regenerated easily if they are lost. Which is the most cost-effective way to store these thumbnails on S3?

Use S3 Standard to store the thumbnails
Use S3 One-Zone Infrequent Access (One-Zone IA) to store the thumbnails
Use S3 Glacier to store the thumbnails
Use S3 Standard Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) to store the thumbnails

---

**ChatGPT:**

Given that the thumbnails are rarely used but need immediate accessibility when required, and they can be easily regenerated if lost, the most cost-effective way to store these thumbnails on Amazon S3 would be to use **S3 One-Zone Infrequent Access (One-Zone IA)**.

S3 One-Zone IA offers a lower-cost storage option compared to S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It provides lower-cost storage but with the same performance and low-latency access as S3 Standard, albeit with the caveat that the data is stored in a single availability zone, which might have less durability compared to S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA that replicate data across multiple availability zones. However, since the thumbnails can be easily regenerated if lost, this reduced durability might not be a significant concern for this specific use case, making One-Zone IA the most cost-effective option.

They are designed to bring AWS services closer to end-users in specific geographic locations, reducing latency by placing compute, storage, and other select AWS services closer to the users.

Therefore, for a gaming company seeking to deliver low-latency gameplay to end-users in various locations, leveraging AWS Local Zones can effectively provide the necessary proximity to users, reducing latency and improving the overall user experience.

46. What is the primary benefit of deploying an RDS database in a Multi-AZ configuration?

Multi-AZ enhances database availability
Multi-AZ protects the database from a regional failure
Multi-AZ improves database performance for read-heavy workloads
Multi-AZ reduces database usage costs

---

**ChatGPT:**

The primary benefit of deploying an RDS database in a Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) configuration is:

**Multi-AZ enhances database availability**

In a Multi-AZ configuration, RDS automatically replicates the database to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone within the same region. This setup provides increased availability and fault tolerance, as in the event of a hardware failure or maintenance in one Availability Zone, RDS can automatically failover to the standby instance in another Zone without manual intervention, reducing downtime and enhancing overall database availability.

50. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about AWS Auto Scaling?

You can automatically remove unhealthy instances
You can automatically register new instances to a Load Balancer
You can automatically deploy AWS Shield when a DDoS attack is detected
You can scale out and add more EC2 instances to match an increase in demand as well as scale in and remove EC2 instances to match a reduced demand

---

**ChatGPT:**

The incorrect statement about AWS Auto Scaling is:

**You can automatically deploy AWS Shield when a DDoS attack is detected.**

AWS Auto Scaling primarily focuses on dynamically adjusting the number of EC2 instances based on demand or predefined metrics. While it facilitates automatic scaling out or in of instances to match varying workloads, it does not directly trigger or deploy AWS Shield, which is a DDoS protection service, in response to detecting a DDoS attack. AWS Shield operates separately as a managed DDoS protection service, and its deployment is not directly integrated into the functionalities of AWS Auto Scaling.

52. Which of the following statements are correct about the AWS account root user (Select two)

Root user credentials should only be shared with managers requiring administrative responsibilities to complete their jobs
Root user access credentials are the email address and password used to create the AWS account
Root user account password cannot be changed once it is set
It is highly recommended to enable Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) for root user account
Root account gets unrestricted permissions when the account is created, but these can be restricted using IAM policies

---

**ChatGPT:**

The correct statements about the AWS account root user are:

- **Root user access credentials are the email address and password used to create the AWS account**: When creating an AWS account, the email address and password used during the account creation process become the access credentials for the root user.
- **It is highly recommended to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the root user account**: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication method (such as a one-time code from a mobile authenticator app) along with the password when signing in as the root user, thus enhancing the security of the root account.

Therefore, the correct statements about the AWS account root user are Root user access credentials are the email address and password used to create the AWS account and It is highly recommended to enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the root user account.
